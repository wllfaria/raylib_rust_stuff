# Raylib Rust Stuff

This exists mainly to save some random raylib projects in rust, i'll try to add
different simulations as I make them, but this might take some time

## How to run a simulation
Just clone the repo, and run the following:

```sh
cargo run -- -s <NAME_OF_SIMULATION>
```

you can check a full list of available simulations with:

```sh
cargo run -- --help
```
